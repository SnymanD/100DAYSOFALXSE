//You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.
//Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). 
//They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

//Race number:

//Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
//All others receive a number below 1000.
//Start time:

//Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
//Early adults run at 9:30 am.
//Late adults run at 11:00 am.
//Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
