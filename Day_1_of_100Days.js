// Introduction to JavaScript
// We will be looking at how to print statements in JS and how to declare variables.

console.log("Introduction to JavaScript"); // This is how to print statements to the console.

// You can have as many statements you want to print as possible
console.log("");

console.log("Adding two numbers in JS");

// Declaring variables - you can declare variables using var, let or const
console.log('');

let num1 = 12; // variables declared with "let" can be changed or overwritten
const num2 = 14; // any variable declared with 'const' can never be changed 

num1 = 16; // This will overwrite the contents of a and set it to 16, therefore adding a and be should be equal to 30.

const sum = num1 + num2;

console.log(sum);
